# NLP-with-Classification-and-Vector-Spaces  

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language. 

This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.  
 
With algorithms, I can design NLP applications that answer questions and analyze sentiment, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even create chatbots. These and other NLP applications will be at the forefront of the upcoming transformation into an AI-powered future.
